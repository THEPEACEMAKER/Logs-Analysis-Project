## Logs Analysis Project - Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree

#### DESCRIPTION
This is the first project in the Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree, and it goes like this:

>I'm hired onto a team working on a newspaper site. The user-facing newspaper site frontend itself, and the database behind it, are already built and running. I'm asked to build an internal reporting tool that will use information from the database to discover what kind of articles the site's readers like.

>my task is to create a reporting tool that runs from the command line, and prints out reports (in plain text) based on the data in the database. This reporting tool is a Python program using the psycopg2 module to connect to the database.

>The database contains newspaper articles, as well as the web server log for the site. The log has a database row for each time a reader loaded a web page. Using that information, my code will answer the following three questions:

1. What are the most popular three articles of all time?
2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time?
3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?
